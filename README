Extra Assertions
===============

There's a few blocks of code I had to write in tests over and over again. To save time and effort, I made them assertions. These are the ones I came up with so far.

You should just be able to install this as a plugin using 

    script/plugin install 

I haven't gemified it yet, but I'll do that later.


Example
=======

Inside your tests:

    assert_valid @model
    assert_invalid @model
    assert_includes [1, 2, 3], 1
    assert_not_includes [1, 2, 3], 4
